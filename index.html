            <p>After receiving my Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry with a minor in Data Science at Northeastern University, I am completing my Master of Science in Biotechnology.
            My research interests focus around how movement and physical function intersect with disease, particularly in vulnerable populations. Whether studying how cancer treatments affect pediatric patients' mobility, how muscle mechanics change with disease, or how dance can serve as rehabilitation, I'm driven by restoring and preserving human movement on a molecular and systematic level. <br>
            <br>    
            Currently, I work as a medical assistant and medical secretary at Mount Auburn Rheumatology, and I am a research intern at the Center for Cognitive and Brain Health at Northeastern University, specifically within 
            the Laboratory for the Scientific Study of Dance <a href='https://labsync.sites.northeastern.edu/' target='_blank'>(LAB:SYNC)</a>. This laboratory analyzes simple and complex models of dance behavior 
            in relation to computer vision algorithms and health outcomes across the lifespan. <br>
            <br>    
            In addition to research, I have a passion for medicine and improving clinical experiences and outcomes for patients by focusing on understanding cultural awareness and socioeconomic barriers to health. 
            I specialize in point of care biometric testing for patients of diverse backgrounds, while working at Quest Diagnostics and volunteering at a local shelter's blood pressure clinic.<br>
            <br>    
            When not in the lab or in the clinic, I spend my time enjoying the outdoors, reading or dancing. 
            I have been dancing for over 18 years, having the opportunity to work as a dancer, choreographer, and as a leader. 
            During my time on the executive board, I spearheaded Revolve Dance Crew’s first showcase, Revolution, inviting collegiate and professional teams around Boston to perform. 
            I also founded Revive, Revolve’s first industry level workshops open to the public. Now, I am a member of N/A (yes as in "Not Applicable"), and we are currently preparing for our show in late July.
