                <h1 class='header1'>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Northeastern University, majoring in Biochemistry with a minor in Data Science. 
            I am also pursuing a PlusOne master's in biotechnology. My background includes preclinical and pharmacological research, 
            with my research interests spanning movement, neurodegenerative disorders, oncology, and pharmacokinetics. <br>
            <br>    
            I am an undergraduate researcher at the Center for Cognitive and Brain Health at Northeastern University, specifically within 
            the Laboratory for the Scientific Study of Dance <a href='https://labsync.sites.northeastern.edu/' target='_blank'>(LAB:SYNC)</a>. This laboratory analyzes simple and complex models of dance behavior 
            in relation to health outcomes across the lifespan. <br>
            <br>    
            In addition to research, I have a passion for medicine and improving clinical experiences and outcomes for patients. 
            I specialize in point of care biometric testing for patients of diverse backgrounds, ranging from factory to financial settings. 
            It has been extremely fulfilling to help screen participants for the “silent killers,” also known as high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. 
            Outside of clinical work, I volunteer at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Tufts Medical Center, and Spaulding Rehabilitative Hospital.<br>
            <br>    
            When not in the lab or in the clinic, I spend my time enjoying the outdoors, reading or dancing. 
            I have been dancing for over 18 years, having the opportunity to work as a dancer, choreographer, and as a leader. 
            During my time on the executive board, I spearheaded Revolve Dance Crew’s first showcase, Revolution, inviting collegiate and professional teams around Boston to perform. 
            I also founded Revive, Revolve’s first industry level workshops open to the public.
